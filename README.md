# PROJECT KR API

* This is the backend of the project written in Ruby on Rails.
[Front end](https://github.com/FottyM/kr_portfolios)

* This applicaion is deployed on [heroku](https://kr-ypton.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup

- start postgresql (whichever way fits you)
- `$ rails db:setup ` or `$ rails db:create && rails db:migrate `
- `$ rails s -p 3001` , the server should run on port 3001 because the front end is running on 3000 and making api calls on port 3001 so don't change it.


## System dependencies
- [x] Ruby on Rails 5.0+
- [x] Ruby version 2.4
- [x] DB: Postgresql 9.6
